dss.c.64.exe is a geostatistics and geosciences modeling stand-alone software. It has several functions to manipulate 2d-3d data as well as provide univariate and multivariate analysis. The software has been developed in CERENA (https://cerena.pt/) research center. 

blockdss is an R package for geostatistical disease mapping and a wrapper for running dss.c.64.exe. blockdss provides R functions to write data frames in format readable by dss.c.64.exe (geoEAS), setting the required parameters, running block direct sequential simulation algorithm and reading the files generated by dss.c.64.exe.

To run blockdss package you first need to download the dss.c.64.exe. First create a folder called `input` in the working directory and copy the zipped dss.c.64.exe inside. If you prefer, you can also run these steps from your R console directly, using the following code:

```
# create folder 'input'
inp <- "./input/"
if(!file.exists(inp)) dir.create(inp, recursive = TRUE)

# download zipped dss.c.64.exe from github
gitURL <- "https://github.com/maluicr/dss/raw/main/DSS.C.64.exe.zip"
utils::download.file(url = gitURL, destfile = paste0(inp, "DSS.C.64.exe.zip"))
```

In a last step, you need to unzip the downloaded file into the same folder (i.e. dss.c.64.exe should stay in folder `./input`).
