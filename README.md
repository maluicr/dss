## Copy dss to run with R package blockdss

blockdss is an R package for geostatistical disease mapping and a wrapper for running dss.c.64.exe. blockdss provides R functions to write data frames in format readable by dss.c.64.exe (geoEAS), setting the required parameters, running block direct sequential simulation algorithm and reading the files generated by dss.c.64.exe.

To run dss.c.64.exe software within the blockdss package, first create a folder called `input` in the working directory and copy the dss.c.64.exe inside. You can also create the folder and copy dss from your R console directly using the following code:
